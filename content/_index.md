# About Me
&NewLine;

I am a recent Computer Science graduate from The University of North Carolina. While I attended Carolina I was a [Chancellor's Science Scholar](https://chancellorssciencescholars.unc.edu) and a part of the Honors College. My research interests include machine learning, blockchain, and crypotgraphy.

During my undergraduate degree I worked in the [Paul Manis Lab](http://www.manislab.org) modeling bushy axons in the brain. I also worked in the [Huttel Lab](https://sites.duke.edu/huettellab/) at Duke University analyzing data from a PADS laser. I participated in the [Duke STAR (Summer Training in Academic Research)](https://dcri.org/education/dukes-star-program) program where I did research on COVID-19 vaccinations rate and healthcare. 

I am currently working on the [Otoro Ethereum Wallet](https://github.com/otoro-wallet), an open source projects that wants to make maanging your eth wallets a breeze!
