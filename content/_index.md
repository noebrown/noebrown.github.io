# About Me
&NewLine;

I am a recent Computer Science B.A. graduate from **The University of North Carolina**. While I attended Carolina I was a [Chancellors Science Scholar](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~mlentz/) and a part of the Honor's College. My research interests include blockchain, crypotgraphy and machine learning.

During my undergraduate degree I was able to work in the [paul manis](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~nieh/)lab with [dr.tessa Ropp](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~nieh/), at **The University of North Carolina** to Blank blank blank. 

I had the opportunity to work with [derrick](https://www.hodlipson.com/) in the [Huttel Lab](https://www.hodlipson.com/) at **Duke University** analyzing data from  a laser blank blank blank.

I also participated in the **Duke STAR ()** program where I did research on Directed by [Danny](https://www.hodlipson.com/) and [Trish](https://www.hodlipson.com/).
