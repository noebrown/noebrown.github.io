**Intro to Machine Learning: COMP**\
The ability to measure and monitor the integrity of containers running on the system fills a gap in observability, trust, and security. However, the mechanism in the Linux kernel for measuring integrity within a system, Integrity Measurement Architecture IMA, does not support Linux containers. This project leverages the kernel's existing support of eBPF to extend the Linux Integrity Measurement Architecture to containers without changes to the host operating system. \

Languages/Tools: Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow

**Modeling of Potassiuam ion Channels**\
A privacy preserving graph data store. The project ported Order Preserving Encryption OPE to Rust to provide range queries over encrypted data. Queries were encrypted using OPE and symmetric encryption. \
